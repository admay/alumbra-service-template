# alumbra-service

A Leiningen template for building GraphQL services using Alumbra.

## Usage

I haven't put this template onto Clojars yet so for now we have to install it locally.

1. `git clone [repo] && cd alumbra-service`
2. `lein install alumbra-service`
3. `cd <workspace directory>`
4. `lein new alumbra-service <project name>`

After that, go to town.
More instructions are in the project README so check that out.
