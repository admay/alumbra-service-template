## Contributing

If you find a bug or want to contribute, you can;

1. Create an issue. I'll check it out as soon as I can.
2. Submit a pull request. I'll check it out as soon as I can.
3. Complain on [r/clojure][rclj]. I'm on there a lot.

I don't want this to be a locked down, no one can touch this code kind of project.
If you have no idea what you're doing but you think you can help, get in touch.
If you have an idea, get in touch.
If you think my template sucks, get in touch.
This project was started for me but I want it to evolve into something for anyone who wants to use it!

## Plans

First and foremost, I'm going to add test cases and some way to run them easily.

After that, my focus is going to be on making this more flexible for other people to use.
How?
I'm not sure yet, I'm going to need some feedback.

I'm also going to have to fix the whole versioning thing...
Yeah, I screwed that one up...

Eventually, this project will be consumed by a more general GraphQL template.
There is no 'holy grail' of libraries so I don't want to lock people into one.
I am currently working on a template that gives developers options to pick either Alumbra or Lacinia.
